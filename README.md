Introducing ChromaDash, a one-of-a-kind, hassle-free dashboard for ChromaDB

I built ChromaDash with a singular goal: to make managing your ChromaDB as simple and smooth as possible. 
You don’t need to mess with dependencies, install Python or Node.js, or worry about complicated setups. 
Just open your browser, and it works—straight out of the box. 

It's all packaged in a single HTML file (with a few images), so all you need to do is launch it, and you’re good to go!

With ChromaDash, you can easily view, add, delete, and edit collections and documents. 
Whether you're managing data or simply checking your document counts, everything is just a click away. 
And, because I wanted to make it as user-friendly as possible, I've included links to all the ChromaDB documentation, helpful resources, and even other GitHub projects to inspire your journey.
